# lacona-weather

Includes the functionality to ask [Lacona](http://www.lacona.io) what the weather is.

## Work in Progress

This is a work in progress as I learn how to develop extensions for Lacona. 
Currently you can type `weather` and will bring up the weather based on your zip code set in your preferences. 

Future things to include: 
* Search by city or zip code
* What's the weather in...
* Support for multiple weather sites
